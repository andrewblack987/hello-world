# hello-world
trial to see how to create a repository 

My name is Andrew Black and I am in 3rd at the Univeristy of Edinburgh currently studying Ecological and Environmental sciences (Bsc)

This semester I am taking a data science course so will be learning how to handle data sets, work on Github and code in R
